# Iterable Utilities

A bunch of utilities for working with iterables, many inspired by the native
array methods.

## Usage

import * as iter from "https://deno.land/x/iter/mod.ts";
// or
import * as iter from "https://deno.land/x/iter@v0.1.1/mod.ts";
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Make a roadmap
- [x] Deploy to [`deno.land/x/`](https://deno.land/x/)
- [ ] Implement reducers
